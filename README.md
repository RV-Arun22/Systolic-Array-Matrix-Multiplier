# Systolic-Array-Matrix-Multiplier
Implemented an 8x8 systolic array matrix multiplier
1. Folders "RTL" and "Testbench":
     - contain files used in Vivado to implement the design on a Xilinx Zynq 7000 series FPGA board (xc7z020clg484-1).
2. Folder "ASIC implementation":
     - contains tcl, constraint & design files used for netlist synthesis in Cadence Genus.
     - generated netlists for targeting area, power, and delay optimization.
